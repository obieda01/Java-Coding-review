 * Title: Radix Sort
 * Project: geekviewpoint
 * Package: algorithms
 *
 * Statement:
 *   Given a disordered list of integers, rearrange them in natural order.
 *
 * Sample Input: {18,5,100,3,1,19,6,0,7,4,2}
 *
 * Sample Output: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,18,19,100}
 *
 * Time Complexity of Solution:
 *   Best Case O(k*n); Average Case O(k*n); Worst Case O(k*n),
 *   where k is the length of the longest number and n is the
 *   size of the input array.
 *
 *   Note: if k is greater than log(n) then an n*log(n) algorithm would be a
 *         better fit. In reality we can always change the radix to make k
 *         less than log(n).
 *
 * Approach:
 *   radix sort, like counting sort and bucket sort, is an integer based
 *   algorithm (i.e. the values of the input array are assumed to be
 *   integers). Hence radix sort is among the fastest sorting algorithms
 *   around, in theory. The particular distinction for radix sort is that it
 *   creates a bucket for each cipher (i.e. digit); as such, similar to
 *   bucket sort, each bucket in radix sort must be a growable list that may
 *   admit different keys.
 *
 *   For decimal values, the number of buckets is 10, as the decimal system
 *   has 10 numerals/cyphers (i.e. 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). Then the keys are
 *   continuously sorted by significant digits.
